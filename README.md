# Dotfiles

Personal dotfiles managed with GNU Stow.

## Layout

- `home/`: files stowed into `$HOME`
- `packages/bundle`: Homebrew bundle for tools this config expects
- `dot`: helper for setup, Oh My Zsh bootstrap, restow, and basic checks
- `home/.zshenv`: minimal PATH and environment shared across zsh contexts

## Bootstrap

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> ~/Code/dotfiles
cd ~/Code/dotfiles
./dot init
```

`./dot init` installs the Homebrew bundle, installs Bun, clones `~/.oh-my-zsh` when missing, and stows `home/` into `$HOME`.

## Neovim

The Neovim configuration requires Neovim 0.11 or newer. Configured formatters include Prettier, Prettierd, Stylua, and Zigfmt.

Oil handles directory editing, while Neo-tree provides a persistent project tree. FFF provides indexed project file and content search; its native binary is downloaded during plugin installation and can fall back to a local Rust toolchain. Snacks provides buffers, help, recent files, LSP and TODO pickers alongside its dashboard, notification, Git, scratch, and toggle features.

Oxfmt and `tsgo` are optional project-local tools. When present, Oxfmt takes priority over Prettier for supported files, and `tsc.nvim` finds `node_modules/.bin/tsgo` automatically.

`home/.vimrc` is a plugin-free keybinding starter for minimal Vim or Neovim installations. Neovim does not load it automatically; source it from an `init.vim` or copy the mappings when bootstrapping a separate setup.

## Commands

```bash
./dot init
./dot stow
./dot doctor
```
