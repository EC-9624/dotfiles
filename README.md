# Dotfiles

Personal dotfiles managed with GNU Stow.

## Layout

- `home/`: files stowed into `$HOME`
- `packages/bundle`: Homebrew bundle for tools this config expects
- `dot`: helper for setup, Oh My Zsh bootstrap, restow, and basic checks
- `home/.zshenv`: minimal PATH and environment shared across zsh contexts

## Bootstrap

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> ~/Code/dotfiles
cd ~/Code/dotfiles
./dot init
```

`./dot init` installs the Homebrew bundle, Bun, OpenCode 2, clones `~/.oh-my-zsh` when missing, and stows `home/` into `$HOME`.

## OpenCode

OpenCode 2 runs as `opencode2` from `~/.opencode/bin`. Keep the official executable name so built-in updates can detect the installation. It uses its built-in managed background service:

```bash
opencode2 service status
opencode2 api get /api/health
opencode2 pair
```

The service listens on localhost by default. For remote access on a trusted network, run `opencode2 service set hostname 0.0.0.0`, then use `opencode2 pair` to authenticate remote clients.

## Themes

Tokyo Night, Rose Pine, and Catppuccin Macchiato are available through a shared terminal-native theme setup. Ghostty, Neovim, Yazi syntax, and OpenCode load theme-specific files through `~/.config/current-theme`; tmux, Starship, lazygit, btop, tmux-palette, and the Yazi interface use the terminal ANSI palette.

```bash
./dot theme tokyo-night
./dot theme rose-pine
./dot theme catppuccin
```

After switching, reload Ghostty with `Cmd+Shift+,` and restart open Neovim, Yazi, and OpenCode sessions.

## Neovim

The Neovim configuration requires Neovim 0.12 or newer. Treesitter parser installation requires tree-sitter CLI 0.26.1 or newer (included in the Homebrew bundle), a C compiler, `tar`, and `curl`. On macOS, install the compiler with `xcode-select --install` if needed. Run `./dot doctor` to check command availability. Configured formatters include Prettier, Prettierd, Stylua, and Zigfmt.

Oil handles directory editing, while Neo-tree provides a persistent project tree. FFF provides indexed project file and content search; its native binary is downloaded during plugin installation and can fall back to a local Rust toolchain. Snacks provides buffers, help, recent files, LSP and TODO pickers alongside its dashboard, notification, Git, scratch, and toggle features.

Oil uses its native LSP file-operation support to update references when files are renamed. Any buffers changed by those edits must be saved separately. `<leader>e` toggles Neo-tree and reveals the current file when opening it.

Oxfmt and `tsgo` are optional project-local tools. When present, Oxfmt takes priority over Prettier for supported files, and `tsc.nvim` finds `node_modules/.bin/tsgo` automatically.

`home/.vimrc` is a plugin-free keybinding starter for minimal Vim or Neovim installations. Neovim does not load it automatically; source it from an `init.vim` or copy the mappings when bootstrapping a separate setup.

## Commands

```bash
./dot init
./dot stow
./dot theme tokyo-night
./dot doctor
```
